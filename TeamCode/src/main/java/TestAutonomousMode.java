    //Initialization:

    //define motors
    //define sensors
    //define encoder ticks for motors
    //define what happens when zero is for the power of motors
    //define robot size and other necessities for Vuforia
    //define 3 variables for blocks placed within crytobox
    //expand servos/test servos

    //When we hit play but before the main loop happens NOTE: any movement is recorded using encoder ticks

    //find enemies color ball with sensor
    //knock over enemies ball with spatula(on the side of robot
    //turn left/right 90 degrees
    //find pictogram
    //determine most points awarded section of crytobox using Vuforia
    //define our "section" of the playing field
    //use encoder ticks to find out where we are when we start moving
    //move forward
    //turn left/right(depending on section of the field) 90
    //move forward to crytobox
    //turn towards crytobox
    //align ourselves "somehow"
    //insert block
    //back away

    //Main play loop
    //spin looking for blocks
    //find blocks using color sensor
    //determine if it is within our "section"
    //if all is good, determine distance from block using rangesensor
    //move towards block
    //grab block with grabber
    //spin looking for Vuhoria
    //determine if distance from robot to Vuhoria is within our "section"
    //if all is good, move towards crytobox
    //align ourselves to the next desired position using the 3 crytobox position available variables
    //insert block
    //repeat until bottom row is filled up(use crytobox position availabe variables to determine)
